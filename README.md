Simple Calculator Program in Assembly Language

This assembly language program implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

1. File:
   - calculator.asm: This file contains the source code for the simple calculator program.

2. How to Compile and Run:
   - To compile the assembly code, you need an assembler like TASM (Turbo Assembler) or NASM (Netwide Assembler).
   - After assembling, you will get the executable file (calculator.exe).
   - Run the executable file (calculator.exe) in a DOS environment or compatible emulator to use the calculator.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the operator (+, -, *, /) and operands.

3. Description of the Program:
   - The program displays a menu prompting the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /).
   - After entering the operator, the user is prompted to enter two operands.
   - Based on the selected operator, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
   - The result is then displayed on the screen.
   - Finally, the program terminates.

4. Notes:
   - The program assumes single-digit operands and performs integer arithmetic.
   - Error handling for invalid input or division by zero is not implemented in this version.
   - This program is written for DOS environment and may require adjustments for other platforms.
   - It's a basic example to understand arithmetic operations in assembly language.
